## Task 5: Filter ToDos by Status

**Description:**  
Add buttons to filter the ToDo list: show all, only completed, or only active todos. Use conditional rendering and state management to implement filtering functionality.

**Requirements:**
- Use `useState` to manage todos and filter state
- Include input field with placeholder "Add todo"
- Include "Add" button to add new todos
- Add filter buttons: "All", "Active", "Completed"
- Implement filtering logic based on completion status
- Display only filtered todos based on selected filter
- Export the component as `export const FilteredToDoList`
- Handle adding, completing, and filtering todos

**Example:**
```jsx
// User clicks "Completed" filter, sees only completed todos
```

**Theoretical Questions:**
1. What is conditional rendering in React and how do you implement it?
2. How do you use the filter method with React state?
3. What are the different ways to conditionally render content in React?
