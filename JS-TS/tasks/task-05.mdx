## Task 5: Mark ToDo as Completed

**Description:**  
Write a function `markCompleted` that takes an array of todos and an id, and returns a new array where the todo with the given id has `completed: true`.

**Example:**
```js
const todos = [
  { id: 1, title: 'Buy milk', completed: false },
  { id: 2, title: 'Read book', completed: false }
];
markCompleted(todos, 2); // [{...}, { id: 2, title: 'Read book', completed: true }]
```
