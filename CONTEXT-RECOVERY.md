# Context Recovery for Pre-Internship ToDo Course

## What This File Does

This file is designed to help you (or your assistant/AI) quickly restore the full context of working with this repository if you continue on another computer or in a new session.

## Repository State

- All tasks for JS/TS, React, Node/Express/Nest, DB/NoSQL, Docker/Git are created and located in their respective `tasks` folders.
- Each topic has a `solutions` folder with stubs for solutions (no ready answers).
- For Node and Nest, template mini-apps are created in `Node-Express-Nest/solutions/express-app` and `Node-Express-Nest/solutions/nest-app` with basic structure, package.json, tsconfig.json, and entry points.
- All tests for tasks are in the `tests` folder or inside the respective template projects.
- The root contains `.gitignore` and a detailed `README.mdx` with instructions on task order and repository workflow.

## How to Continue Working

1. **Open this repository on a new computer.**
2. **Read `README.mdx` to understand the structure and workflow.**
3. **All tasks, solutions, and tests are ready — you can immediately start coding, running tests, and pushing changes.**
4. **If using an AI assistant, just state that you have already completed all previous steps from this file and continue the conversation from any point.**

## Important for AI Assistants

- All tasks are already created, solutions are only stubs, tests are ready.
- Do not recreate the structure, just help with implementation, testing, refinement, or task analysis.
- If you need to restore any file or structure, use this file as the source of truth for context.
